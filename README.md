This project was created with [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template.

## Description
This project is a new practical item of my mobile app series that made with:
- react native v0.65.1
- [the-movie-database-api](https://www.themoviedb.org/) - (to fetch movies and casting data)
- [@react-navigation/stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/) - (to screen transitions)
- [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - (to screen transitions)
- Of course, I used things like custom hooks, components and helpers.

## You'll need a TMDB (The Movie Database) account to access API service
Don't forget this 'cause I don't provide my api_key for this public project.
- [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

### To access API fetch:
- Go to CONSTANTS folder and open index.ts
- Replace 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' to your TMDB api_key
